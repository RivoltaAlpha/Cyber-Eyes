                    In the vibrant landscape of technological innovation, the journey to the formation of Cyber Eyes Networks in 2023 was a tale spun by two aspiring minds, Brian Karanja and Brian Ndegwa, hailing from diverse universities - Kirinyaga University and Dedan Kimathi University of Technology. United by a shared vision, their alliance birthed a dynamic and forward-thinking organization that stands as a beacon of change in Africa's technology arena. With core values deeply rooted in cybersecurity excellence, coding innovation, and community empowerment, Cyber Eyes Networks emerged as a technology hub that brings a unique blend of expertise, creativity, and a steadfast commitment to ethical practices. In the eloquent words of Steve Jobs, "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower," and indeed, Cyber Eyes Networks is on a relentless pursuit of innovation, poised to revolutionize the technological landscape across the continent.
